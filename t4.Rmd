## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(caret)
data(mtcars)

# Split data into training and testing sets (80-20 split)
set.seed(123)
trainIndex <- createDataPartition(mtcars$mpg, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
trainData <- mtcars[trainIndex, ]
testData <- mtcars[-trainIndex, ]

# Preprocess: scale the data
preProc <- preProcess(trainData, method = c("center", "scale"))
trainScaled <- predict(preProc, trainData)
testScaled <- predict(preProc, testData)

# Train linear regression model
model <- train(mpg ~ ., data = trainScaled, method = "lm")

# Predict on test set
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = testScaled)

# Evaluate with RMSE
rmse <- sqrt(mean((predictions - testScaled$mpg)^2))
print(paste("RMSE:", rmse))
```
